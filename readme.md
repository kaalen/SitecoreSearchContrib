<h1>Branch with code that compiles agains Sitecore 7.0</h1>
This branch contains code for the Crawler and Searcher projects which compiles against dlls shipped with Sitecore 7.0.
No comprehensive testing has been done but the code appears to work (search results and all) 
and as far as I remember I didn't have to modify assoicated config include files for custom search indexes.
